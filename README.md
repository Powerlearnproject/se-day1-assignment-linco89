Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It applies engineering principles and programming languages towards the building of these softwares thereby providing solutions to man's problems.
The world today is a global village powered by technology. These technology cut across various aspect of human lives such as education, commerce, healthcare, communication and what have you. Software engineering provides applicatons/softwares that power these areas thereby enabling the use of technology effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages such as C etc
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

REQUIREMENTS: This stage involves the gathering and collection of users needs and system requirements.
DESIGN: This involves creating designs of the software based on the the data collected.
IMPLEMENTATION: This is the building stage that involves writing of codes and building the software according to the specifications.
TESTING: This stage involves conducting various tests to check if the software meets the quality standard needed.
DEPLOYMENT: This has to do with the release of the software to users after meeting standard quality.
MAINTENANCE:This is the last stage in software development life cycle. It involves providing regular maintenace, updates and support to the software.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
