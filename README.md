#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It applies engineering principles and programming languages towards the building of these softwares thereby providing solutions to man's problems.
The world today is a global village powered by technology. These technology cut across various aspect of human lives such as education, commerce, healthcare, communication and what have you. Software engineering provides applicatons/softwares that power these areas thereby enabling the use of technology effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages such as C etc
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

REQUIREMENTS: This stage involves the gathering and collection of users needs and system requirements.
DESIGN: This involves creating designs of the software based on the the data collected.
IMPLEMENTATION: This is the building stage that involves writing of codes and building the software according to the specifications.
TESTING: This stage involves conducting various tests to check if the software meets the quality standard needed.
DEPLOYMENT: This has to do with the release of the software to users after meeting standard quality.
MAINTENANCE:This is the last stage in software development life cycle. It involves providing regular maintenace, updates and support to the software.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a rigid methodology and a linear system that requires a team to complete each project phases before moving to the next one. Its good for projects that has a well defined goal and doesnt change in a long run.

Agile methodolog is  flexible in nature, and allow room for team to work on different phases of the project simultaneously. It is suited for project undergoing research and testing.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer writes the code needed to build the software, a quality assuarance engineer tests the software for standard quality by designing tests, while a project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

VCS are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight deadline, funding issues, changing rquirements.

Some of the ways to overcome these are by:

Efective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  - 
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering can be defined as the process of giving and specifying statements to get the best response and answers from an AI.

Its very important because it enables us to get accurate and best responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"what's the best university in Nigeria?" 
The best question could be " whats the best university of technology in Nigeria"

The latter is better because the question is specified and directed.
